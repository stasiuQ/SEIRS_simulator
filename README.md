# Complex_systems

Project implementing agent-based stochastical epidemilogical SEIRS model (COVID-19). Using Unity engine as a GUI and precompiled C++ dll libraries as a model.
The main idea of this simulator is to visualise an evolution of the system and present all statistics in the real time. It should be also possible to pause the simulation and change some model parameters ad hoc.
Another feature is implementing some mechanisms used by governments in order to limit the spreading of a disease, such as lockdowns, masks and social distancing.
